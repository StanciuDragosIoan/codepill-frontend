Intro to **Web Development**.

As the title involves, this article represents an introduction to web development. We will see very briefly how the web works and we will get a bit familiar with the main technologies of the web (namely HTML , CSS and JavaScript). Finally, after 'getting our feet wet' a bit, and understanding how everything works, we will build a little project together.

This project will be a nice warm-up for future projects, and it will help
you get familiar with how a JavaScript application is built, without any
framework. This will help you regardless of which framework you will use
(as you will build something using the full power of JavaScript, power on
which all the hot frameworks now and I mean React, Angular or VueJS are
built).

Well ... first of all, React is a "library" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

```js
if (true) {
  return "hmmm...";
}

console.log("It works!");
```

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

```js
if (true) {
  return "hmmm...";
}

console.log("It works!");
```
